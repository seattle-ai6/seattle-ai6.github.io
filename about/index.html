	<h1>About Seattle AI6</h1>
	<p>So are we, so when we saw that nurture.ai was rolling out their [AI Saturdays](https://nurture.ai/ai-saturdays) Syllabus nationwide, we couldn't wait to get started!</p>
  <p>Our first chapter [meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-AI-Saturdays/events/246269987/) was on the last Saturday of December 2017, in a downtown Seattle Starbucks. A dozen or so AI enthusiasts gathered to find out what we were about.</p>
  <p>Over the next few weeks, committed AI programmers stuck with us while we found a venue sponsor for our first 15-week session. Thankfully, [Code Fellows](codefellows.org) opened their doors to us, and we kicked off 2018 digging into AI, using fast.ai and Stanford study materials to guide our study sessions.</p>
